## Multi-App Deployment

The suite can load only selected product modules.

Backend:

```env
INSTALLED_APPS=hrms
```

```env
INSTALLED_APPS=crm,project_management
```

Frontend:

```env
VITE_INSTALLED_APPS=hrms
```

```env
VITE_INSTALLED_APPS=crm,project_management
```

See `docs/multi_app_architecture.md` for the module split and next cleanup
step around common people/profile data.

## Local Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Create a backend `.env` when needed:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://user:password@host:3306/aihrms
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
```

## Local Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Optional frontend `.env`:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# Frontend production build
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## Deployment Notes

- Backend and frontend are designed to be hosted separately.
- Frontend API routing is controlled by `VITE_API_BASE_URL` / runtime config.
- Backend database configuration is controlled by `DATABASE_URL`.
- Upload folders are runtime storage and are intentionally ignored by git.

## Current Product Status

The project has moved beyond MVP into a broad HRMS foundation with production-grade database/API coverage across HR, payroll, compliance, talent, documents, workflow, and analytics. Some modules still need final production integrations such as government portal connectors, e-sign, biometric vendor SDKs, WhatsApp Business dispatch, SSO, and scheduled report exports.
